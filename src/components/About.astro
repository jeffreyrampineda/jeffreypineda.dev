      <p class="mb-4">Hey! What&apos;s up?</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        I&apos;m Jeffrey, a Toronto-based Full-Stack Developer with a strong
        passion for innovative and creative ideas. Heavily interested in
        data-centric applications to which machine learning technologies can be
        applied to.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        My approach as a front-end developer emphasizes attention to detail and
        user-centered design, utilizing evidence to guide decisions and improve
        usability.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Similarly, my methods of back-end development involve commonly used
        design patterns to structure databases, servers, and APIs to ensure that
        the client-side can function seamlessly while maintaining flexibilityâ€”
        adapting to current and future needs.
